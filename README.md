# DomainDraw
 DomainDraw draws a macromolecule schematic diagram illustrating the presence and position of one or more motifs or domains. Typically it
 is used to represent and visualise multiple domains on one or more proteins. Some example images are included in the distribution here.
 
DomainDraw is written as a Perl plug-in to the GIMP. The code is out of date and has not been updated since GIMP 2.4. As such, do not expect it to work out of the box. The intension is to make the code available in case anyone else wants to play with it. Maybe I'll get some time to fix it up to work with GIMP 2.8, but this is not likely to happen for a while. If you do fix it up, please let me know :-)

Up to date information on running Perl plug-ins in GIMP can be found at https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Perl/

A server running DomainDraw can be found at http://domaindraw.imb.uq.edu.au/

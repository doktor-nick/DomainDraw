DomainDraw Install Guide
------------------------
If you find DomainDraw useful in your research, please reference
the publication listed below.

Prerequisites:
--------------

DomainDraw requires The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to be
installed. GIMP is available for Unix and other platforms and may
be downloaded from www.gimp.org.

DomainDraw has been tested using:
 GIMP 1.2.3  under RedHat linux 9.0
 GIMP 2.2.0  with Fedora Core 4 linux. 
 GIMP 2.2.14 with Fedora Core 10 linux (using the GIMP rpms from Fedora Core 7)
 GIMP 2.4.7  with Fedora Core 10 linux (using the GIMP rpms from Fedora Core 8)

Please contact the authors if you experience difficulties.

Installing:
-----------
GIMP needs to be installed. Version 2.0, 2.2 or 2.4 is recommended.

NOTE: DomainDraw will not work with GIMP 2.6 since this version 
of GIMP does not support gimp-perl.

The GIMP development libraries should also be installed.If you are
installing via rpms, these will typically be called:
 gimp, gimp-libs and gimp-devel.   
 
Some perl modules are required. See the "What you need" section of 
  http://gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Perl/
for required modules. Basically you need to install:
  Perl 5.005 or later
  The GTK2 perl module  (http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net)
  The Gimp perl module (ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/plug-ins/)

NOTE: the 2.2 version of the gimp perl module will work with
both GIMP 2.2 and GIMP 2.4 (ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/plug-ins/v2.2/perl/)

The above modules are also available from cpan.org, or maybe available
already in/for your linux distribution. The perl modules may
require other modules to be installed depending on your distribution.
These can also be found a cpan.

Once GIMP and the above perl modules have been installed,
Copy the script domain.pl into the GIMP plug-ins directory.
On unix systems this will usually be a subdirectory of your
home directory of the form
 ~yourhomedir/.gimp-X.Y/plug-ins/
where X.Y is the version of GIMP being used. This directory is
automatically created the first time GIMP is run.

Make sure the domain.pl file has executable permissions.

Running DomainDraw:
-------------------

1. Run GIMP.

2. On the Xtns/Perl-Fu menu select DomainDraw. A pop-up window will
   appear.

3. Enter the name of the file containing the domain information into
   the Batchfile box. Either give the complete path to the file, or
   if the file is in the same directory from which you started GIMP
   just the file name may be given.

   The format of the input file is explained fully 
   on the DomainDraw website at:
    http://domaindraw.imb.uq.edu.au/
   An example file dd_example2.txt is in this distribution. 

4. Alter other input parameters as required. Defaults should
   be fine for most purposes.

5. Click OK.

Parameters:
-----------
Are described on the DomainDraw website:
 http://domaindraw.imb.uq.edu.au/ 
and in the paper listed below.

Using a GIMP command line usage and server:
-------------------------------------------

The GIMP supports image generation from the command line
without the need to start up a user interface. For instance
executing:

./domain.pl -batchfile dd_example2.txt -o dd_example2.png

with take the domain information supplied in the file
dd_example2.txt and generate the image dd_example2.png

GIMP may also be run as a server. The script domain.pl can then be run
as a command line script which communicates with the GIMP server.
The advantage of this is that graphics may then be generated "on the
fly" without user interaction, and without starting up GIMP for each
image generated. An example of this may be found at
the web interface to DomainDraw given below. The disadvantage is that 
setting up GIMP server can be complicated for new users. 

If you chose to set up a GIMP server, you will need to
1. Read the documentation on the GIMP web site on server configuration
   http://gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Perl/
2. Modify the domain.pl script so that line 29
    $ENV{'GIMP_HOST'} = 'pwd@localhost';
   is no longer commented out, and change pwd@localhost as required.


Common Problems:
----------------
Finding fonts can sometimes cause difficulties. Try selecting a common 
font like Times 12 point.
